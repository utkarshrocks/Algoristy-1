A sequence diagram simply depicts interaction between objects in a sequential order i.e. the order in which these interactions take place. We can also use the terms event diagrams or event scenarios to refer to a sequence diagram. Sequence diagrams describe how and in what order the objects in a system function. These diagrams are widely used by businessmen and software developers to document and understand requirements for new and existing systems.

Sequence Diagram Notations –

1). Actors – An actor in a UML diagram represents a type of role where it interacts with the system and its objects. It is important to note here that an actor is always outside the scope of the system we aim to model using the UML diagram.

2). Lifelines – A lifeline is a named element which depicts an individual participant in a sequence diagram. So basically each instance in a sequence diagram is represented by a lifeline. Lifeline elements are located at the top in a sequence diagram.

3). Messages – Communication between objects is depicted using messages. The messages appear in a sequential order on the lifeline. We represent messages using arrows. Lifelines and messages form the core of a sequence diagram.

4). Guards – To model conditions we use guards in UML. They are used when we need to restrict the flow of messages on the pretext of a condition being met. Guards play an important role in letting software developers know the constraints attached to a system or a particular process.
